Your task is to complete the program below by writing three methods (askInfo, copyInfo and setArray). 
Program should ask for integers (max 100 integers) until the users types in zero. 
Integers can vary from one to one hundred and they are stored in an array that has 100 elements. 
Numbers are asked for with the askInfo method, which receives the array with numbers as parameter. 
Method returns the number of integers. 
The number zero is not saved in the array; it is merely used to stop giving input. 
The given numbers are then copied to another array which size is the amount of given numbers. 
Copying is done with copyInfo method which receives both arrays as parameters. 
After this the elements of the new array are put in ascending order with setArray method and printed on screen with printArray method.
